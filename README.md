Install-Instructions
npm i
npm i jest
npm init -y

Usage-Info
After installing dependencies invoke the program by typing 'npm run test' & "npm run start". Select the prompts that are shown in the terminal in the terminal. Starting with viewing the roles and employees first will be easier to navigate through the menu when adding any of the above. At this time I anm unable to generate the HTML from the information given by each employee title (Manager, Employee, Engineer, and Intern.)
